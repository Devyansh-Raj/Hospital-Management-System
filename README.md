🏥 Hospital Management System

A simple web-based Hospital Management System built using Flask.
This project allows users to register, log in, browse doctors, book appointments, and view prescriptions. It also includes separate dashboards for Admins, Doctors, and Patients.

This is a personal learning project where I explored backend architecture, database modelling, and UI using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Jinja2, and Bootstrap.
